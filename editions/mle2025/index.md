## About

Software-intensive systems are complicated, driven by the need to integrate across multiple concerns.
Consequently, the development of such systems requires the integration of different concerns and skills.
These concerns can be covered by different domain-specific modeling languages, with specific concepts, technologies, and abstraction levels.
This multiplication of languages eases the development related to each individual specific concern but raises language and technology integration problems at the different stages of the software life cycle.
To reason about the global system as a whole, it is necessary to explicitly describe the different kinds of relationships that exist between the different languages used in its development.
To support effective language integration, there is a pressing need to reify and classify these relationships, as well as the language interactions that the relationships enable.
Equally, the proliferation of domain-specific modeling languages required increases the need for effective and efficient techniques for engineering languages and their support infrastructures (transformations, analysis tools, editors, execution infrastructure, debuggers, …).

The Modeling Language Engineering (MLE) workshop aims at bringing together researchers and practitioners working on modeling-language and software-language engineering. It is a meeting opportunity for Software Language Engineering (SLE) enthusiasts within the software-modeling community.

### Topics

The topics of interest for MLE 2025 include:

- Methodologies, languages, techniques, and methods for designing and implementing modeling languages
- Composition, extension, and reuse of modeling languages and model execution tools
- Heterogeneous modeling, simulation, and execution
- Customization of modeling languages
- Integration of modeling languages and programming languages
- Semantics-aware model transformations and code generation
- Scalability of model execution and execution-based model analysis
- Execution of partial and underspecified models
- Model execution in the presence of non-determinism and concurrency
- Tracing model executions and analyzing model execution traces
- Model execution tools for the (dynamic) validation, verification, and testing of systems (e.g., model animation, debugging, simulation, trace exploration, model checking, symbolic execution)
- Live modeling and exploratory modeling techniques
- Automation techniques for the development of modeling and model execution tools
- Evolution in the context of executable modeling (e.g.} evolution of executable modeling languages, execution semantics, executable models, model execution tools)
- Verification of semantic conformance (e.g., among executable modeling languages, executable models, model execution tools)
- Integration challenges for languages, from requirements to design, for analysis and simulation, during runtime, etc.
- Case studies and experience reports on the successful or failed adoption of modeling in different application domains and application contexts
- Surveys and benchmarks of different approaches for the development of modeling languages, model execution, and execution-based model analysis

Submissions describing practical and industrial experience related to the use of modeling languages are also encouraged, particularly in the following application domains:
Cyber-Physical Systems, Smart Manufacturing, Industry 4.0; Internet of Services, Internet of Things; Smart City, Smart Building, Home automation; Smart and Learning systems.

### Workshop Format

This full-day workshop will prioritize discussions over presentations. We plan to open with a keynote in the morning, followed by paper presentations.
The afternoon will then be spent primarily in discussions inspired by topics raised by the keynotes and paper presentations.
Where there is sufficient divergence in the topics raised, we will create break-out groups of participants interested in each sub-topic. The goal of these discussions is to identify commonalities and connections between different topics, support research networking, cross-pollination, and informal knowledge transfer.
The final session of the workshop will be focused on summarizing the key topics and ideas discussed at the workshop to help identify the next steps that may be followed up by workshop participants.

### Submission

For each of the aforementioned topics, authors are invited to submit a paper of 6 pages following the IEEE format (ieeetran). Up to two additional pages containing only references are permitted. The workshop is open to the following types of submissions: 

- vision papers
- technical (novel approach) papers
- experience report papers; and
- ramp-up papers.

Where all submissions shall relate to the topic of "modeling language engineering in 2035". Ramp-up papers are papers not meant for publication but for
discussion and refining at the workshop to lead to submission at a related venue (such as the SLE conference). Ramp-up papers will be reviewed with
this in mind and will receive more time for discussion during the workshop. Also, submitted papers can be accompanied by concrete artifacts, such as
models (requirements, design, analysis, transformation, composition, etc.), stored in a public repository. 

All submissions have to follow the IEEE format and must be submitted electronically in PDF format via [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences?
conf=mle2025). They will be evaluated by at least three members of the program committee regarding novelty, correctness, significance, readability,
and alignment with the workshop call. More precisely, the PC will evaluate: 

- For vision papers, the impact, scope, and plausibility of the vision;
- For technical papers and ramp-up papers, the soundness and the novelty of the proposed approach;
- For experience report papers, the empirical protocol and the impact of its outcomes;

Furthermore, all submissions must be original work and must not have been previously published or being under review elsewhere. The accepted papers which are not ramp-up papers, will be included in the joint workshop proceedings published by the IEEE.
